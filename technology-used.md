#### **1. User Interface Design**

* **Figma**\
  The user interface of the application was carefully designed using **Figma**, a collaborative design tool that allowed our team to create clean and user-friendly screens. Through Figma, we prototyped and refined the app's layout, ensuring a experience that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.\

#### **2.** Mobile Application Development

* **Flutter & Dart**\
  The entire mobile application is built using **Flutter**, Google’s powerful cross-platform UI toolkit. With Flutter and its underlying programming language **Dart**, we developed a high-performance application that works smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.\

* **State Management with Provider**\
  To ensure the application’s data flow is clear and efficient, we implemented **Provider**, a widely-used state management solution in Flutter. This allows us to manage the app’s state seamlessly — from handling survey responses and student data to ensuring real-time updates and smooth interactions across the app.



#### 3. Backend Services and Authentication

&#x20; **Firebase**\
&#x20; Our application uses firebase to provide powerful backend functionalities without the need to\
&#x20; manage complex server infrastructure. The Firebase services we integrated include:

* **Firebase Authentication**: Secure and reliable user authentication, enabling students and administrators to log in and access the application safely.
* **Cloud Firestore**: A scalable, real-time database that stores all survey data, student information, and departmental assignments, ensuring quick data access and synchronization.
