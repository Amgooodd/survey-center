# Groups screen

The **Groups Page** in **Survey Center** allows admins to efficiently organize students into their respective departments. This ensures that surveys can be distributed accurately and relevantly, based on department-specific participation.

#### 1. **Department Cards**

The main section of the Groups Page displays a collection of **Department Cards**, each representing a different department within the faculty.

* **Department Name**: Clearly displayed on each card for easy identification.
* **Department Photo**: A distinctive image or icon is associated with each department to make it visually recognizable at a glance.
* **Clean Layout**: The cards are organized in a grid format, allowing admins to quickly view all available departments.

#### 2. **Add Students Button**

At the bottom of the Groups Page, there is a prominent **“Add Students”** button that allows admins to bulk import student data into the system.

* **Upload File Option**: Admins can upload either an **Excel (.xlsx)** or **CSV (.csv)** file.

* **File Format Requirement**: The uploaded file must follow a specific structure to ensure accurate data import.
* **Automatic Assignment**: Once the file is uploaded and processed, each student is automatically assigned to their respective department based on the "Department" column in the file.
* The required columns in the file are:
  * **Department**: The department the student belongs to (must match one of the existing department names)
  * **ID**: Unique student ID
  * **Name**: Full name of the student
