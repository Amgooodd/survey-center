# Create survey screen

The **Create Survey Page** in **Survey Center** empowers admins to design and configure tailored surveys that fit the needs of their departments. The page offers a step-by-step interface to define survey details, target audiences, and build meaningful questions.

#### 1. Choose **Survey Name**

At the top of the page, admins can enter the **title** of the survey.

* **Required Field**: A clear, descriptive name helps students recognize the purpose of the survey.

#### 2. **Select Target Departments**

Admins can specify which departments will have access to answer the survey.

  * Select one or multiple departments from the list.
  * Option to **Select All** departments with a single click for broader surveys.

#### 3. **Survey Visibility Options**

After choosing the departments, admins can define how the survey appears to them using two options:

* **Exact Department Only**:
  * Only the **exactly selected departments** will see the survey.
* **Separate Department Access**:
  * Each selected department will see the survey individually, even if they are merged with other departments.

These visibility rules help ensure that surveys reach only the intended student groups.

#### 4. **Set Deadline**

Admins can define an **expiration date** for the survey.

* **Deadline Picker**: Select a specific date after which students will no longer be able to submit responses.
* Helps ensure timely data collection and clear survey duration.

* **One-time Response**:
  * Each student can answer the survey **only once**.
  * Prevents duplicate or skewed responses.
* **Multiple Responses Allowed**:
  * Students can submit the survey **more than once** if needed.
