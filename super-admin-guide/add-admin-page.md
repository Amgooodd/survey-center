# Add admin page

The **Add Admin Page** is a specialized feature that is accessible **only to the Super Admin** in **Survey Center**. This page allows the super admin to manage admin accounts by adding new admins and deleting existing ones. It provides an easy-to-use interface to facilitate the addition of new admins with default credentials and the ability to delete any admin when needed.

#### 1. **See current admins and deletion option**&#x20;

* In addition to adding new admins, the super admin also has the ability to **delete existing admins**.
* A list of all admins will be displayed on this page, with an option to **delete** any admin from the system.
  * Deleting an admin removes them from the system entirely, including any access they have to surveys, departments, and other admin-related functions.

* Clicking this button opens a form where the super admin can enter the following details for the new admin:
  * **Admin ID**: A unique identifier that will be used for the admin's login. This ID must be distinct for each admin.
  * **Admin Name**: The name of the admin being added, which will be associated with their account.

#### 3. **Default Password Generation**

* Once the **Admin ID** and **Name** are entered, the system **automatically generates a random default password** for the new admin.
* This default password is intended to be provided to the new admin **in secret** by the super admin, ensuring secure access during the first login.
* When the new admin enters their **ID** and **default password** on the sign-up page, they can complete the sign-up process by setting their **new password**.
