# Submit answers

The **Survey Submission Page** is designed to provide students with a smooth and guided experience when filling out a survey. It ensures students answer all the questions before submission and provides feedback on their progress throughout the process. After completing the survey, students will be greeted with a **Thank You message** confirming their submission.

#### 1. **Survey Header**

* **Progress Bar**: A **progress bar** runs across the top, visually showing how much of the survey has been completed and how many questions are left to answer. This provides students with a clear sense of their progress and how much is remaining.
