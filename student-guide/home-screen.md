# Home screen

The **Student Home Screen** in **Survey Center** provides students with a simple yet effective interface for engaging with surveys assigned to their department. The home screen focuses on convenience and user experience, featuring **real-time notifications** and a **survey section** tailored specifically to each student’s needs.

#### 1. **Notification Icon in the Head Bar**

* **Real-Time Survey Notifications**: The **notification icon** in the **head bar** alerts students about important updates related to surveys:
  * **New Surveys**: The student will be notified when a new survey has been assigned to their department and is available for participation.
  * **Deadline Reminders**: The notification will also alert the student when the deadline of an active survey is approaching, ensuring they have enough time to complete it before it closes.
