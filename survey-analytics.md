# Survey analytics

The **Survey Analytics Screen** in **Survey Center** provides admins with a visual representation of the survey data. This page helps to analyze how students have responded to each question, presenting the results using charts and tables for clearer insights. The screen includes pie charts, bar charts, and detailed frequency tables to support data-driven decision-making.

#### 1. **Survey Questions Overview**

The Survey Analytics Screen displays a list of all questions that were part of the survey, providing an overview of the surveyâ€™s data.

* Each question is displayed with its corresponding **visualization** below it.

#### **Pie & bar Chart for Multiple Choice Questions**

For each multiple-choice question, a **Pie Chart** is generated to show the percentage distribution of responses.

* **Visual Representation**: Each slice represents the percentage of students who selected a specific answer.
* This allows admins to quickly assess the overall sentiment or distribution of answers for each question.
* **Interactive Hovering**: Hovering over each segment of the chart displays the exact percentage and the answer it represents.
